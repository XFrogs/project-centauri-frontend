## Main dependencies
1. React router dom -> allow us to break our app in routes
2. bulma io -> css framework to quickly give style to components
3. node-sass -> allow us to use scss instead of css
4. axios -> fetch library

## Project structure
**Routes folder**: contains the main pages of the app eg. main page, marketplace, profile, etc

**Common**: contains components that are used all along the website eg. Navbar. footer.
